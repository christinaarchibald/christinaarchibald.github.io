    <p>
  My name is Christina Archibald I'm 15 years old and I'm from Oakland, California. My birthday is decemeber 18,2003 I was born in Berkeley, California which is like 15 mintues away fromm Oakland. I go to a small school in Oakland called Life Academy of health and bioscience.
      By the looks of the name of my school you can tell that my school is really in to science and health. To be honest all of our teachers want us to go into the health or some type of STEAM field based on all the adviance classes we take and the interships they give us.
      I've been going there since the middle of 7th grade since its a middle school and high school. I am on my schools vollyball team which is really fun though my team is'nt the best in our district we work really good together . Im am a really out going person
      so never be afraid to talk to me!

      Besides playing vollyball I play arhcery. I started when I was like in 6th or 7th grade so i was like 12🤷🏽‍. But I remember being really great it on my first try. But even before that I remember my mom got me this suction cup arrows so that I could shoot them around the house and not get hurt.</p>
